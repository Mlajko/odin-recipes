        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, diced</li>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups cauliflower florets</li>
            <li>1 cup green beans</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or saucepan. Add mushrooms, onions, and garlic; cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in carrots, potatoes, and celery. Stir in cauliflower and green beans; add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix water, cornstarch, and soy sauce in a small bowl until cornstarch is completely dissolved; stir into vegetables and cook until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll out 1/2 of the dough to line an 11x7-inch baking dish. Pour vegetable filling into the pastry-lined dish. Roll out remaining dough; arrange over filling, then seal and flute the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until pie is golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
